# Toolshed - Known Issues and Technical Debt

This document outlines critical issues, technical debt, and areas for improvement identified in the Toolshed codebase.

## Issue Priority System

**P0 - Critical**: System-breaking issues, security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks
**P1 - High**: Core functionality broken, major user experience issues
**P2 - Medium**: Feature gaps, minor user experience problems
**P3 - Low**: Nice-to-have improvements, minor convenience issues
**P4 - Backlog**: Future enhancements, technical debt

## P0 - Critical Issues

### 3. Missing Overlapping Reservation Validation

**Impact**: High - Core business logic missing
**Location**: Noted in README.md but not implemented

- No validation for overlapping reservations on item booking
- Could result in double-booking of items
- Quantity management not enforced

**Action Required**: Implement availability checking in reservation creation logic.

### 4. Incomplete Item Tracking in Reservations

**Impact**: High - Data integrity issue
**Location**: `server/storage.ts:346-350`

```typescript
private getItemIdFromFirstEvent(reservationId: string): string {
  // For now, return empty string - this would need to be tracked properly
  // In a real implementation, we'd store item_id in the reservation events
  return '';
}
```

**Action Required**: Implement proper item_id tracking in reservation events.

## P1 - High Priority Issues

### 5. Missing Input Validation

**Impact**: Medium-High - Security and data integrity

- No apparent input validation in API routes
- No schema validation for request bodies
- Missing sanitization of user inputs

**Recommendations**:

- Add Zod or similar schema validation library
- Implement request validation middleware

### 6. Incomplete Error Handling

**Impact**: Medium-High - Poor user experience

- Limited error handling in API routes
- No standardized error response format
- Missing proper HTTP status codes

### 7. No Database Migration System

**Impact**: Medium-High - Deployment and development issues

- No database schema versioning
- No migration scripts for schema changes
- Difficult to maintain database consistency across environments

**Recommendations**: Implement Drizzle migrations or similar system.

## P2 - Medium Priority Issues

### 8. Missing Development Documentation

**Impact**: Medium - Developer onboarding

- No setup instructions for local development
- Missing environment variable documentation
- No contribution guidelines

**Action Required**: Create comprehensive development setup guide.

### 9. No Build and Deployment Configuration

**Impact**: Medium - DevOps

- No build scripts beyond basic package.json
- Missing deployment configuration
- No CI/CD pipeline setup

### 10. Incomplete Business Logic Features

**Impact**: Medium - Feature completeness

- No damage reporting workflow
- No dispute resolution system
- Missing notification system for reservation updates

## P3 - Low Priority Issues

### 11. Missing Monitoring and Logging

**Impact**: Low - Operational visibility

- No application logging framework
- No error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- No performance monitoring

### 12. API Documentation Gaps

**Impact**: Low - Developer experience

- Limited API documentation
- No OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Missing examples for API usage

## P4 - Backlog Items

### 13. Advanced User Features

**Impact**: Very Low - Future enhancements

- User profile photos/avatars
- User rating and review system
- Advanced search and filtering
- Mobile app companion
- Push notifications
- Social features (following neighbors, activity feeds)

### 14. Advanced Tool Management

**Impact**: Very Low - Nice-to-have features

- Tool maintenance scheduling
- Usage analytics for tool owners
- Automatic availability management
- Integration with external calendars
- QR code generation for physical tools

## Code Quality Observations

### Positive Aspects

- ✅ Excellent TypeScript usage with proper type definitions
- ✅ Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- ✅ Event sourcing pattern well implemented
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Good use of modern React/Remix patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive README with business logic documentation

### Areas for Improvement

- ❌ Inconsistent error handling patterns
- ❌ Missing JSDoc comments for complex functions
- ❌ Some TODO comments indicate incomplete features
- ❌ No linting or formatting configuration visible

## Suggested Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1 (P0 - Critical)**:
   - Fix authentication/navigation UI inconsistency
   - Add app header to profile page
   - Fix authentication security issue
   - Implement basic testing framework

2. **Phase 2 (P1 - High Priority)**:
   - Add item_id tracking to reservations
   - Add overlapping reservation validation
   - Implement input validation
   - Add proper error handling

3. **Phase 3 (P2-P3 - Medium/Low Priority)**:
   - Set up database migrations
   - Add development documentation
   - Implement monitoring/logging
   - Complete business logic features

4. **Phase 4 (P4 - Future Enhancements)**:
   - Advanced user features
   - Advanced tool management
   - Add comprehensive API documentation
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

When implementing testing, consider this approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Focus on business logic (reservation state computation, validation functions)
2. **Integration Tests**: Database operations and API endpoints
3. **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows (registration, item creation, reservation workflow)
4. **Contract Tests**: API contract validation

## Security Recommendations

1. Implement proper password hashing consistency
2. Add input validation and sanitization
3. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Add CSRF protection for forms
5. Validate and sanitize file uploads (for item photos)
6. Implement proper session management configuration
